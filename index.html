        <h1>SVR.JS is discontinued</h1>
        <p>We want to thank all our users and supporters of SVR.JS. After careful consideration, we have decided to
            discontinue SVR.JS. This decision allows us to focus on the development of <a
                href="https://www.ferronweb.org">Ferron</a>, a fast and memory-safe
            web server written in Rust, and to optimize our infrastructure costs.</p>
        <p>SVR.JS has been an incredible journey, and we truly appreciate the community that has formed around it. If
            you&apos;re looking for a high-performance web server, we encourage you to check out Ferron, which
            represents our
            vision for the future of web server technology.</p>
        <p>Thank you for being part of this project. We appreciate your support and look forward to building even better
            solutions together.</p>
        <p>â€” The SVR.JS Team</p>
